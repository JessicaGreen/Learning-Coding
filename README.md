# Learning-Coding
I recently participated in a closed, trial PgCert course at Birkbeck, University of London: Computing for Cultural Heritage - an introduction to Python and SQL for data analytics in libraries/archives. This repository is for my coursework and continued learning through online tutorials and Codebar London.
